Just a bunch of scripts made in python, to work with LLMs. Nothing new here

## Tutorial: Setting Up Virtual Environment

1. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd ProjectA
```

2. Create a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv transformerEnv
```

3. Activate the virtual environment:

```bash
source transformerEnv/bin/activate
```

4. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Now, you are ready.


## Deactivating the Virtual Environment

When you're done experimenting and want to deactivate the virtual environment, simply run:

```bash
deactivate
```

This will exit the virtual environment and return you to your normal shell.
